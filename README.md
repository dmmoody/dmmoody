# 🚀 Engineering for Impact — At Scale and In Service

**Hi, I’m Duane Moody — a principal-level engineer, systems architect, and founder of [XRiley LLC](https://dxrlabs.github.io).**

Through [DXR Labs](https://github.com/dxrlabs), I lead software innovation efforts that span client consulting, internal platforms, and open-source tooling — all focused on solving real human and business problems with code.

## 🔧 What I Build

I specialize in backend systems that demand **reliability, clarity, and scale**. My expertise includes:

- **Microservice and event-driven architecture**
- **Cloud-native and containerized systems**
- **Data-driven APIs and integration-heavy services**
- **Developer tooling and documentation strategies**

I work fluently in Go, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and Node.js — and across frameworks like Rails, Django, Flask, Express, React, and Next.js. I’ve architected and maintained platforms backed by PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, MySQL, Kafka, and Pub/Sub — with deployments in GCP environments and Docker-based pipelines.

## 🏢 Enterprise-Scale, Delivery-Focused

I bring deep experience delivering software in **high-regulation, high-availability environments**. My contributions have included:

- Leading **production migrations** of legacy services to modern cloud infrastructure  
- Designing and implementing **account verification and financial data pipelines**  
- Building **event consumers** and service documentation for distributed systems  
- Advocating for **test strategy improvements and engineering clarity** within platform teams  

Throughout, I’ve worked across functional boundaries — collaborating with architects, product leads, and engineers to keep complex systems understandable and maintainable.

## ⚙️ DXR Labs: Innovation in Practice

At DXR Labs, I apply everything I’ve learned from enterprise software to modernize dev environments, explore architectural patterns, and lead applied R&D. It’s where I prototype new systems, incubate OSS tools, and mentor developers through initiatives like **CodeScouts** — focused on technical growth and community contribution.

## 👥 Who I Work With

I partner with:

- **Engineering teams** navigating complexity at scale  
- **Product orgs** seeking delivery-focused senior contributors  
- **Consulting clients** who need pragmatic software systems that align with business value  
- **Technical leaders** who want experience-backed input without ego or hand-waving

## 🧭 My Operating Principles

- **Solve the right problem.** Tools don’t matter if you’re solving the wrong thing.
- **Clarity over cleverness.** Good systems don’t require guesswork.  
- **Leave it better than you found it.** Code, docs, pipelines, patterns — it all matters.
- **Ship. Learn. Repeat.** I value output and clarity over perfection and delay.
